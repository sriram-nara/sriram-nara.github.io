I’m a Ph.D. student fascinated by the intersection of robotics, control theory, and programming. My work combines data-driven modeling, machine learning and estimation theory to identify/learn, estimate and control complex systems. I’m deeply curious about how machines work and how we can design smarter systems to solve real-world challenges. As I prepare for the next chapter, I’m eager to apply my technical expertise and creativity to projects that bridge theory and applications with hands-on innovation.


Research Interests
===================
I am interested in estimating dynamic systems and control using data-driven system identification and machine-learning methods. Some areas of interest that I have been working on or wish to explore include, but are not limited to:

- **Estimation and control of partially observable dynamical systems:**  
  Learning dynamical systems with missing/partial or low-fidelity measurements or unknown parameters, data-driven modeling and control of complex physical systems, machine learning methods for estimating such dynamical systems and control, causal inference methods, and developing a unifying theory in this domain.

- **Robotics and Control:**  
  Developing machine learning methods for robot autonomy, focusing on control in partially observable environments. Applying reinforcement learning and data-driven control strategies to enhance robot navigation and decision-making under uncertainty.

- **Stochastic Modeling and Control:**
  Developing methods for controlling systems with inherent randomness, using probabilistic techniques and stochastic optimization to handle uncertainty in dynamics and measurements.

- **Off-Line vs. On-Line Computations:**  
  Exploring trade-offs between offline (design-time) and online (run-time) computations, particularly in Model Predictive Control (MPC) and reinforcement learning.

- **Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Methods:**  
  Investigating trade-offs in control systems applications: Using parametric models for verification, fault diagnosis, and policy transfer between systems.

- **Space Domain Awareness:**  
  Predictive modeling for space debris tracking, anomaly detection in space systems, optimizing satellite operations with machine learning, data fusion for comprehensive space situational awareness, uncertainty propagation, tracking, and data correlation.

- **Cislunar Applications:**  
  Timeseries predictive modeling, augmented physics models for enhanced forecasting.
